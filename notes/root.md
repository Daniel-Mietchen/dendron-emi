The Earth Metabolome Initiative, abbreviated EMI is an Open Science initiative and a global effort to profile the metabolic content of all currently known species on our planet (~2.3 million species). We are building the required computational, scientific and organizational architecture to establish the network of ressources and humans to advance in this massive undertaking. The EMI will explore the chemical foundations of Life for a better human society within a thriving biosphere.

# How is it related to the Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative ?

We have started the Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative, abbreviated DBGI, as a pilot project for the EMI. You will be able to find more details on the DBGI at <https://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi>
